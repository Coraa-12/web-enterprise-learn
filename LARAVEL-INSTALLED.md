## ✅ Verification Checklist

Test these to confirm everything works:

- [ ] **Docker is running** - Look for whale icon in taskbar

- [ ] **Database is accessible** - Visit http://localhost:8081 (login: root / secret)
- [ ] **Migrations work** - Run `migrate.bat` (should show "Nothing to migrate")
- [ ] **Artisan commands work** - Run `laravel-helper.bat` and choose option 8

If any of these fail, check **TROUBLESHOOTING.md**.

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to database"
**Fix:**
1. Run `start.bat` (containers must be running)
2. Check `.env` file has `DB_HOST=mysql` (not `127.0.0.1`)
3. Run `docker compose restart mysql`

### "404 Not Found" on routes
**Fix:**
```powershell
docker compose exec php php artisan route:clear
docker compose exec php php artisan cache:clear
```

### Changes not showing in browser
**Fix:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` in browser
2. Clear Laravel caches: Run `laravel-helper.bat` → Option 5
3. Restart containers: `restart.bat`

### Generic "Something went wrong"
**Fix (The Magic Trio):**
```batch
1. stop.bat
2. start.bat
3. Refresh browser (Ctrl + F5)
```
This fixes 80% of issues!
